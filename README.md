# Epoch Engine

# A custom 3D Game Engine by Travis Vroman

This game engine intially has a Vulkan back-end, but will eventually also support DirectX and OpenGL. It is designed with it in mind to be cross-platform compatible, although in its initial stages only currently works on Windows. Thus far, it has no external dependencies.
